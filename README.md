Testing github's repository


Hey there,

I have experience in the fields of IT and QA and now studying System Analysis in a respectfull institute. 
Due to my studies, i was suggested to learn using this platform for improving my skills and maybe even help others by sharing from my knowledge and abilities.

I hope ill get creative enough or open minded to create and develope an open source application\software to help society in some way.

Dont know coding professionally yet but learning and aquring them fast at the moment.
